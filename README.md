## üìä Data Cleaning and Transformation Summary

### ‚úÖ Cleaned Elements:

- Standardized column names using `janitor::make_clean_names()`.
- Removed unwanted characters from `name` column using `stringr`.
- Fixed common typos such as:
  - `ALEXASNDRIA` ‚Üí `ALEXANDRIA`
  - `ALLLEN` ‚Üí `ALLEN`
- Converted population fields to numeric and created a `Total_Population` column.
- Converted Excel serial numbers in `last_inspection_end_date` into readable `Date` format using `as.Date()`.

### üìâ Missing Values:
- Missing `last_inspection_end_date` values were **preserved as NA** for data integrity and to support descriptive statistics or quality control analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Data Correction

Some entries lacked names despite having valid city information. These were looked up manually due to a lack of reliable pattern-matching.

| City | Corrected Name | Source |
|------|----------------|--------|
| DOVER | DOVER ICE FIELD OFFICE | Google Search / ICE Office Directory |
| ELK RIVER | SHERBURNE COUNTY JAIL | ICE Detention Center List |

**Code Used**:
```r
data$name[is.na(data$name) & data$city == "DOVER"] <- "DOVER ICE FIELD OFFICE"
data$name[is.na(data$name) & data$city == "ELK RIVER"] <- "SHERBURNE COUNTY JAIL"
